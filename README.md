# Two-Wheeled-Self-Balancing-Robot
A two wheeled self balancing robot is a mechatronic system that has two independently driven wheels to balance in gravity centre above the axis of the wheel. These type of robots are basedd on the physical problem of an inverted pendulum and require active control to keep them stable. Two wheeled balancing robots provide a broad area of research which may provide a future for the further development of locomtion in everyday robots.

## Mechatronics System Design (MSD) Approch
VDI Guideline 2206 addresses a particular design methodology in particular and proposes the
“V-Model” for the development process. The entire V-Model is broken down into three important
phases namely, system design, modelling and model analysis, and system integration. After analysing
the requirements on the total system, the sub-functions and sub-systems are defined. After verification
of the sub-functions and testing the sub-systems, these are integrated stepwise into the overall system.
Then, the performance of the integrated system is checked by analysis and evaluation in order to
assure its properties. On following this method, if the end product matches with the one desired, the
process is terminated. If the system needs improvement, the initial operation phase is iterated. The
methodology is useful for dividing the design process into several design phases and providing
precise methods for the distinct product development steps.

## Revised Problem Statement 
“To design a compact automated and reasonably priced two wheeled self balancing
robot that is used for educational purposes to help students with mechatronics.”
